# Bedrocktimize
Bedrocktimize is a really useful resource pack that adds and allows you to access many settings that are organized in their respective settings panels. Bedrocktimize changes the settings interface and start screen interface while keeping minecraftâ€™s vanilla style.

Please do not redistribute bedrocktimize to any other sites or people. This includes reuploads, new links, ect other than the ones I apply.
